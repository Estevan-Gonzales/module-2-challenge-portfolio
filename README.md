# Module 2 Challenge - Portfolio

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 2 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This project is my online portfolio that I will build on as I progress through the class.
Portfolios are needed to show potential recruiters you have experience building tangible projects and solutions.
Through this project, I have learned how to better market myself as a developer.
